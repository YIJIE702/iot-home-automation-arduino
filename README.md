# 🏠 **IoT-based Home Automation System (Arduino + MIT App Inventor)**

## 📖 **Introduction**
The **IoT-based Home Automation System** is designed to improve energy efficiency, enhance security, and provide users with convenient control over household appliances.  

This system allows users to:
- View **temperature, humidity, and light intensity levels** in real-time.  
- Automatically **control lights, curtains, and door locks**.  
- Monitor and interact with the system using a **mobile app (MIT App Inventor)** via the cloud (Firebase).  

The project leverages **Arduino (NodeMCU ESP8266)** with sensors and actuators to automate everyday household tasks, creating a safer, smarter, and more energy-efficient living environment.

## 🎯 **Objectives**
1. Design an **automatic curtain** system that closes when the LDR detects a certain light intensity.  
2. Implement an **automatic indoor light system** that illuminates the room when it is dark.  
3. Develop a **user-friendly mobile application** that allows the user to monitor home conditions and control devices remotely.

- **Core Controller:** NodeMCU ESP8266 WiFi Module  
- **Sensors:**  
  - LDR (Light Intensity)  
  - DHT22 (Temperature & Humidity)  
- **Outputs:**  
  - Relay Module (Light Bulb)  
  - Servo Motor (Curtain Pulley System)  
  - I2C 20x4 LCD Display  
- **App & Cloud:**  
  - MIT App Inventor (Android app)  
  - Firebase (Cloud database & authentication)

1. User logs in to the MIT App Inventor app.  
   - Wrong password → *Access Denied*.  
   - Correct password → *Welcome Back!* → Access to monitoring dashboard.  
2. LCD & MIT app display sensor readings in real-time.  
3. Curtain and bulb behavior depend on **LDR readings**:  
   - < 800 lux → Bulb ON, Curtain Closed.  
   - ≥ 800 lux → Bulb OFF, Curtain Open.  
4. User can lock/unlock the door from the MIT app (controlled via a servo motor).

## 📐 **Specifications**
- **NodeMCU ESP8266**: WiFi connectivity and main controller.  
- **Servo Motor**: Acts as pulley system for curtain automation.  
- **LDR Sensor**: Measures ambient light intensity.  
- **Relay Module + Light Bulb**: Controls lighting based on room brightness.  
- **DHT22 Sensor**: Measures humidity and temperature.  
- **I2C 20x4 LCD**: Displays all monitoring conditions (temperature, humidity, light level, door, bulb, curtain).  
- **MIT App Inventor**: Provides user interface with password authentication.
